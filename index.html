<div class="Thoughts"><p>Funny enough I found this quote cleverly placed next to a bike lane. The first thing that came to my head when I read this is to simply never give up. I’ve definitely had moments where I’ve felt stressed out and wanted to quit. Moments where I thought I couldn’t reach my goals. It was my self-doubt that made me feel this way. I remember when I was making my portfolio to submit to Parsons, I thought everything I made wasn’t good enough, absolute trash. I had to pick myself up and remind myself that I am good at what I do and I do have talent. And clearly I was right cause here I am, writing code for a class at Parsons. If I had given up I wouldn’t be here today, literally living my dream. I think self-doubt is what kills a lot of dreams. So I am making a promise to myself to never give up what I want, even when it gets hard. I will ride until my wheels fall off. </p>
